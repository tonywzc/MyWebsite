            <h2>Clubhouse & Super Bowl</h2>
            <h3>Tony Wang</h3>
            <p> <br><br>Alright, let&rsquo;s get started. <br><br>
                First off, I&rsquo;m writing in English simply because I can have a better flow. Chinese is my mother tongue but I could not be as efficient with the words &ndash; would always try to portray too much and sound more well-rounded in a way. Since this article is mainly observational &amp; informational, I would try to be more concise to capture what I thought about today, in English. <br><br>
                Secondly, clubhouse. It&rsquo;s one of the things that pops up and everyone&rsquo;s asking about it. I was not a fan, still am not &ndash; but I did spend around 1 hour to listen to a chatroom regarding the topic of how Chinese people in the US think about going back to China to live. I will list my observations and thoughts as bullet lists below. <br><br>
            </p>
            <p>Observations:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>There is a moderator in each room – kind of solved the issue of people overlapping, especially during some heated topics when everyone wants to talk. </li>
                <li>Users seem to be high-end. Educated at least. Profile completion rate is high.  </li>
                <li>Room seems to be long existed. The room is still open when I check in the afternoon, several hours later.</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <p>Thoughts:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>I should read more books to avoid covering topics outside of my reach. Some people are not making much sense when they speak, and I think that stems from a lack of knowledge and information inputs.</li>
                <li>Only a small fraction of the total time spent is useful – I’m trying to listen to people with similar backgrounds sharing their thoughts but found few of them. My target is not clear going in. </li>
                <li>The app could be a useful tool when you have more time, or nothing better to do (driving). Put it on as an educational/informational podcast (a high-end room in Chinese) would be of much better assimilation.</li>
            </ul>
