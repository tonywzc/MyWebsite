            <h2>Clubhouse & Super Bowl</h2>
            <h3>Tony Wang</h3>
            <p> <br><br>Alright, let&rsquo;s get started. <br><br>
                First off, I&rsquo;m writing in English simply because I can have a better flow. Chinese is my mother tongue but I could not be as efficient with the words &ndash; would always try to portray too much and sound more well-rounded in a way. Since this article is mainly observational &amp; informational, I would try to be more concise to capture what I thought about today, in English. <br><br>
                Secondly, clubhouse. It&rsquo;s one of the things that pops up and everyone&rsquo;s asking about it. I was not a fan, still am not &ndash; but I did spend around 1 hour to listen to a chatroom regarding the topic of how Chinese people in the US think about going back to China to live. I will list my observations and thoughts as bullet lists below. <br><br>
            </p>
            <p>Observations:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>There is a moderator in each room – kind of solved the issue of people overlapping, especially during some heated topics when everyone wants to talk. </li>
                <li>Users seem to be high-end. Educated at least. Profile completion rate is high.  </li>
                <li>Room seems to be long existed. The room is still open when I check in the afternoon, several hours later.</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <p>Thoughts:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>I should read more books to avoid covering topics outside of my reach. Some people are not making much sense when they speak, and I think that stems from a lack of knowledge and information inputs.</li>
                <li>Only a small fraction of the total time spent is useful – I’m trying to listen to people with similar backgrounds sharing their thoughts but found few of them. My target is not clear going in. </li>
                <li>The app could be a useful tool when you have more time, or nothing better to do (driving). Put it on as an educational/informational podcast (a high-end room in Chinese) would be of much better assimilation.</li>
            </ul><br>
            <p>Okay sorry I went away to code this article out on here as you see. Went into some CSS rabbit hole as always. You see I&rsquo;m rambling here but hey, this is my blog, and I can say whatever I want here. Haha, isn&rsquo;t that amazing. <br><br>
                Anyways, I think clubhouse could be of great use for me if I&rsquo;m using it correctly. I could potentially use it as a networking tool &ndash; a quicker way to sort people out by interests than LinkedIn. <br><br>
                Okay, thirdly, Superbowl. I have been in the US for five years, but I have not seen the full length of Superbowl, not even once. Today I wanted to check out the midgame show, but the game is just an easy piggy ride. Spoiler alert: Tom Brady Won.
            </p><br>
            <p>Observations:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>A list of different ads during the halftime show (incomplete) </li>
                <ul><li>	Carmax</li>
                    <li>Northwestern mutual</li>
                    <li>Rocket mortgage halftime report</li>
                    <li>Official NFL</li>
                    <li>Pepsi Halftime Show</li></ul>
                
                <li>A list of different ads after the halftime show (incomplete)</li>
                <ul> <li>	Glarice CBS original </li>
                    <li>Tough as nails new season CBS original</li>
                    <li>Protein shake</li>
                    <li>Marines</li></ul>
               
                <li>The Weekend Blurred out some curse words for the family friendly Sunday sport event.</li>
                <li>A list of some of his best songs performed (each is around 1.5min performance)</li>
                <ul><li>Starboy</li>
                    <li>I can’t feel my face</li>
                    <li>I feel it coming</li></ul>
                <li>The Raymond James stadium (65890) Almost full from the look and here is the numbers:</li>
                <ul><img src="../images/Writing/Clubhouse & Superbowl/Picture7.png" alt="numbers"></ul>
                <li>Some pictures from live: It really is a big deal for America</li>
                <ul>
                    <img src="../images/Writing/Clubhouse & Superbowl/Picture1.png" alt="numbers">
                    <img src="../images/Writing/Clubhouse & Superbowl/Picture2.png" alt="numbers">
                    <img src="../images/Writing/Clubhouse & Superbowl/Picture3.png" alt="numbers">
                    <img src="../images/Writing/Clubhouse & Superbowl/Picture4.png" alt="numbers">
                    <img src="../images/Writing/Clubhouse & Superbowl/Picture5.png" alt="numbers">
                    <img src="../images/Writing/Clubhouse & Superbowl/Picture6.png" alt="numbers"></ul>
            </ul><br>
            <p>Thoughts:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>America really don’t care about COVID that much. Money rules.</li>
                <li> IPG360 would be studying the logo exposure and naming rights. Boring but necessary business.</li>
                <li>The idea of having 3 different team units for football seems a bit redundant to me.</li>
                </ul><br>
            <p>Status of today: Am having a headache. I ran 2 miles today at a slower speed (22&rsquo;28&lsquo;&rsquo;) after stopped for a week. Did not cook at all. Also, might reconsider posting contents in this way. Converting word to good-looking html is a bit of a pain. Might try to embed again. <br><br>
                Good night world. Tomorrow is Monday the fun day. <br><br>
