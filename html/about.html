        <h1>Hi there! thanks for visiting. 
          <br>Nice to e-meet you.</h1>
        <br><br>
        <p>My name is Tony, in case you are Chinese thinking that is a barber name, the name is given to me by a pre-school English teacher, and I used it till this day. If you are not Chinese, don't worry about it. It's an inside joke.</p>
        <p>Born and raised in Beijing, China, I moved to the US (LA, to be specific) at the age of 18. After 4 golden years at UCLA, I joined Microsoft as a consultant. As you see, I love the six things 
          listed in home page, but I'm' always curious about the world and trying to understand more. 
        </p>
        <p> I love new friends. If you are on this website, my guess is we already know each other. By any chance if you have not met me (neither online nor in person), click on the contact me tab
          and send me an email/connect on LinkedIn.I would love to talk and learn from you. </p>
        <p>If I'm not working, sleeping, cooking, singing in the shower, I'm mostly likely eating, or, very rarely in COVID era, working out. Again, thank you for visiting my website. Feel free to hang around and check out some of my stuff. As always, I welcome feedback. </p>
        <p>Before you leave this page: Life is fantastic. Music is the best human invention. Have a great day.</p>
